		 * Question 39 : Account Transactions Write a program to allow users to perform
		 * the following transactions on their bank account. • Deposit • Withdraw
		 * Display the balance amount after the completion of each transaction. Note: •
		 * Create a class called Account with 2 private member variables o accountNumber
		 * of type String o balance of type int • Include 2 argument constructor. •
		 * Include getter / setter method for accountNumber. • Include only getter for
		 * balance. • Create a method deposit() based on below method signature. Add
		 * transactionAmount to the balance instance variable. public void deposit(int
		 * transactionAmount) • Create another method withdraw() which reduces the
		 * balance amount based on the transactionAmount. If the balances go below zero
		 * after withdrawal, then the transaction should not be performed, and the
		 * earlier balance should be retained. This method displays insufficient balance
		 * when the balance is about to go below zero. public void withdraw(int
		 * transactionAmount) Sample Input and Output1: Enter the Account Number 1000321
		 * Enter the Account Balance 5000 Enter 1 to deposit an amount, 2 to withdraw an
		 * amount 1 Enter the amount to deposit 1000 Your balance after the transaction
		 * is: 6000 Sample Input and Output2: Enter the Account Number 1000321 Enter the
		 * Account Balance 5000 Enter 1 to deposit an amount, 2 to withdraw an amount 2
		 * Enter the amount to withdraw 1000 Your balance after the transaction is: 4000
		 * Sample Input and Output3: Enter the Account Number 1000321 Enter the Account
		 * Balance 5000 Enter 1 to deposit an amount, 2 to withdraw an amount 2 Enter
