		 * First line of the input is an integer value that corresponds to the number of
		 * tents in the camp. The next n lines of input contains the number of refugees
		 * staying in each of the tents. Output Format: Output should print the total
		 * number of citizens present in the camp. Sample Input and Output: 5 10 12 30
		 * 12 12 76
